Writing guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------
There are some format rulings and you easily can following it by copy an already existing
docbook file such if you are going to write a new example use darkroom/examples/crossdeveloping.xml
as a template for your own example.

Do NOT change table layouts etc. we want the document consistent!

Each section should be tagged with status "draft" <sect2 status="draft">...</sect2>
when someone have reviewed your section you should change status to "final" to get
the section into final usermanual document and also the translators will get this text for
translations.

Building the final usermanual
---------------------------------------------------------

is for producing a manual for ditribution...

make darktable-usermanual-final.pdf



Building final translated manual
--------------------------------------------------------
when building a translated manual the content would only include sections with status "final" 
and where status is not set. so with other words, no section with status "draft" will occur.

make sv



Translators
--------------------------------------------------------
To add you language just simple edit po/LINGUAS and add your language code.

To initialize the po file enter the po directory and execute 'make <language code>' to initialize a new <language code>.po file
from the template.

For updating po file from the template just enter the po directory and execute 'make <language code>'
